The script **polarity_model_full_dataset.py** generates the polarity model based on the full data set [add link here]. Accuracy : 87%
The script **polarity_model_sample10p.py** performs the same job on 10%  of the dataset. Accuracy : 86%

Surprisingly, the accuracy is not significantly increasing when training the model with much bigger dataset

To use the model generated with the full dataset, run the following code
